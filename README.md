@created on     : 2024-10-28

This repository creates a note for the transclusion/concatenating of multiple notes together in a single note as a plug-in for [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/). 

## Getting the template or root file set up.

To create your root note:

1. The template note must contain a list of note titles or links
2. One on each line in the order desired
3. Eash line with a note title must start with %%% and a space.
4. Everything else in the template file will be ignored

To activate the plugin

1. The user must have the template note open
2. The transcluded file is output into a "Plugin Window" for review and also the system clipboard.
3. The output is also copied to the clipboard for placement in other applications
